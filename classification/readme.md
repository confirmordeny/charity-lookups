# Classifications

A collection of definitions of classifications relevant to non profit organisations.

 - International Classification of Non-profit and Third Sector Organizations (ICNP/TSO) - [[CSV](classification/icnptso.csv)]
 - [International Classification of Non-profit Organisations (ICNPO)](classification/icnpo.md) - [[CSV](classification/icnpo.csv)]
 - [National Taxonomy of Exempt Entities (NTEE)](classification/ntee.md) - [[CSV](classification/ntee.csv)]
 - [Charity Commission for England and Wales](classification/ccew.md) - [[CSV](classification/ccew.csv)]
 - Standard Industrial Classification (SIC2007 - UK version) - [[CSV](classification/sic2007.csv)]

There is also a [lookup (csv) between SIC2007 and ISIC and ICNPO](classification/icnpo_sic_lookup.csv). This is based on lookup table T3.3 in the [UN Handbook on Non-Profit Institutions in the System of National Accounts 2011 [pdf]](http://ccss.jhu.edu/wp-content/uploads/downloads/2011/08/UNHB_English.pdf), updated to SIC2007.

The source for the ICNP/TSO classification is the [UN Satellite Account on Non-profit and Related Institutions and Volunteer Work 2018 [pdf]](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/nationalaccount/docs/UN_TSE_HB_FNL_web.pdf).
